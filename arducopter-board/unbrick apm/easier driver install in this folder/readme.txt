pick your isp usbasp or usbtiny from the combo box
mine says avrisp mk11..
pick libusb 1.2.6.0
then click install driver.

for windows 10 you may need to install
libusbk 

You should now be able to run the unbrick file "unbrick usbasp"
or "unbrick usbtiny"   .. no need to install 
driver-atmel-bundle-7.0.888 or
libusb-win32-bin-1.2.6.0 folder..
